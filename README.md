# Anamoly-Detection
Anomaly Detection in Industrial control system using Novelty detection methods

• Collected 600,000 samples of sensor data from HAI systems that consisted of various processes such as Boiler process, Water 
treatment plan based on measurement-based intrusion detection. 

• Cleaned, standardized, engineered sensor data using python libraries, Random Forests Feature importance and deployed the 
data into AWS, Jupyter labs which helped in improving the computation speed by 5 times.

• Enhanced ability to detect anomalies or outliers or attacks using semi supervised classifiers such as One class SVM, Isolation 
Forests, Multi-layer perceptron, LGBM classifier, Auto Encoders resulting in detection of attacks by 23%
